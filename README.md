Since Instagram's API has changed quite a bit and I haven't touched this in several years now. Just gonna archive it.

Framework to teach me API usage and learn a little bit more about Python and its web frameworks. 

Feedagram is an app powered by Python's Flask framework. It's a little plugin that creates an image carousel on your website.
